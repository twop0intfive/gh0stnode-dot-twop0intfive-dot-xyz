## Creating a New Blog Post on gh0stnode.twop0intfive.xyz
This document outlines the step-by-step process for creating a new blog post on https://gh0stnode.twop0intfive.xyz. 

Follow these instructions carefully to ensure your post is published correctly.


### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a GitHub account and are logged in.
- Familiarize yourself with basic Markdown syntax for formatting your post.


### Steps to Create a New Blog Post
1) Log into GitHub
- Open your web browser and navigate to the GitHub website.
- Enter your credentials to log in to your GitHub account.
2) Navigate to the Repository
- Once logged in, go to your repository named gh0stnode-dot-twop0intfive-dot-xyz.
3) Access the _posts Directory
- Within the repository, locate and click on the _posts directory. This is where all blog posts are stored.
4) Copy an Existing Post's Content
- Choose any existing post within the _posts directory.
- Click on the post file to open it.
- Click on the "Raw" button to view the raw file contents.
- Select all the text and copy it to your clipboard.
5) Return to the _posts Directory
- Navigate back to the _posts directory by clicking on it in the repository's file structure.
6) Create a New File
- Click on the "Add file" button located at the top right of the file list.
- Select "Create new file" from the dropdown menu.
7) Paste Copied Contents
- In the new file editor, paste the contents you copied earlier from an existing post.
8) Title the New File
- Name your new file using the following format: YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md.
- Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the current date.
- Replace title-of-post with a descriptive title for your blog post, using hyphens instead of spaces.
9) Edit and Format the Post
- Modify the pasted content as necessary to create your new blog post.
- Ensure that you follow Markdown rules for formatting (e.g., headings, lists, links).
- Write or paste your actual blog content into this section.
10) Save and Commit Changes
- Once you have finished editing, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
- Click on "Commit new file" to save your changes and commit them directly to the branch.


### Important Note
This method must be followed precisely as described above because creating posts from within a codespace does not immediately publish them. Posting directly via GitHub ensures that posts are published correctly and promptly.
