Here's another test post! I'm excited to share that we have:
- An updated deployment script 
- We’re also beginning work on creating several new cloud endpoints.


Before I start writing, I need to make sure everything is set up the way I want on the technical side. I plan to show a working version of my resiliency idea before diving into more in-depth writing. One of my first posts will probably explain what I’m working on right now, so others can use it as a guide if they’d like.

I'm also working on a few bigger projects at the same time, so that might make this take a bit longer to finish.
